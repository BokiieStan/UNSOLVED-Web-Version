## "Where sanity is optional, and the truth is fragmented."

*You’re not just a detective — you’re the last thread holding reality together.*

* 📂 Crack open corrupted case files.
* 🔍 Piece together shredded truths from whispers, lies, and... whatever that was in the corner of your screen.
* 🎙️ Interrogate suspects that lie, tremble, and glance at things they shouldn't see.
* 🧠 Manage your sanity — or don’t. Hallucinations might help.
* 🖥️ Navigate through glitchy terminals, flickering evidence, and a cursed interface that fights back.
* 🌙 And when night falls… the DLC begins.
- Prepare for interactive crime solving with eerie visuals, text-to-speech suspects, ambient dread, and a whole lot of "Wait... did the evidence just move?"

Built in Python, made playable through dark code rituals (and some web magic).
